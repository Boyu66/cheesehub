How to use this guide? 
======================

While the material in this guide can
be used as is to gain a broad understanding of some specific cybersecurity bugs
and their solutions; this guide is ideally used in conjunction with CHEESEHub.
CHEESEHub hosts demonstrations of the cybersecurity bugs and solutions described
in this guide. Users can get a first-hand look at the cybersecurity bug in
action, its possible real-world implications, and, verify that the solution (if
any) does indeed resolve the bug.  

Who is this guide for?  
----------------------

This guide is for cybersecurity educators, students, or anyone else seeking both a broad
understanding and practical hands-on exploration of some key cybersecurity
topics and issues.  


**Educators**

Educators can use this guide and
the associated CHEESEHub demonstrations to supplement their classroom
instruction. This guide is designed to be dynamic, with new content being added
as time progresses. As more cybersecurity demonstrations are added to CHEESEHub,
associated documentation will be added to this guide. The demonstrations
themselves are not designed to be comprehensive, covering every aspect of the
cybersecurity bug. Instead, they are intended to give the user an illustrative
example of the bug that can help supplement regular classroom instruction on the
topic.  

**Students**

Students can use this guide to both learn about cybersecurity
concepts that they are unfamiliar with, and, also gain new insights into
concepts they are already familiar with. They can also use the CHEESEHub
demonstrations to supplement their understanding of concepts taught in their
coursework.  

**Contributors**

Contributors to CHEESEHub can use this guide to
understand both the types of cybersecurity concepts that have been included, as
well as, the documentation that would be required for any new contribution.

Cybersecurity Overview 
----------------------

Cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of security
issues related to computer software, hardware, and, communications. Due to the
use of computing resources for managing privileged information, each of these
issues can have far-reaching real-world consequences. The hosted applications on
CHEESEHub attempt to illustrate such real-world consequences wherever possible.
