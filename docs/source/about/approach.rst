Our Approach
============


Open source platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CHEESE system builds on the `Try-CybSI <http://try.cybersecurity.ieee.org>`_
and National Data Service (NDS) `Labs Workbench <http://www.nationaldataservice.org/projects/labs.html>`_ platforms. Try-CybSI provides the core containerized hands-on
environments.  The Labs Workbench platform provides a scalable and customizable
framework for the deployment and management of containized applications.


Open source curriculum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CHEESE curriculum will be modeled after the successful 
`Carpentries <https://carpentries.org>`_ framework. Lessons will be developed
as open source modules that can easily be extended, incorporated into classroom 
instruction, workshops, and used for self-paced learning.


Community outreach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A goal of the CHEESE project is to develop a learning ecosystem that engages a
broad community of cybersecurity educators, practitioners, and students to
contribute to and benefit from the platform.  The project team will engage a
variety of partners from cybersecurity education communities and professional
organizatinos.

Usability
^^^^^^^^^

The CHEESE project will evaluate the usability of the system through services
provided by the  Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI).

Evaluation
^^^^^^^^^^

The CHEESE project team will conduct formal evaluations of the content, workflow 
of content creation, and the impact of the provided materials on cybersecurity
education through quantitative studies.
